    CSE 425 Lab 3: Resolving Horn Clauses in C++
    Team Members: Anqi Zhang(zhanganqi@wustl.edu), Yu Xiao(xiao.y@wustl.edu)
========================================================================

This lab is intended to continue to broaden your experience with programming 
language features and design approaches in C++, and with expression parsing, 
representation, matching, and transformation techniques (again using Horn 
clauses from logic programming as a specific example), including:
    (1) Again parsing and storing representations of Horn clauses;
    (2) Again unifying predicates but this time doing so based on bound and 
        unbound variables as well as numeric constants, this time within the 
        context of a copy of a pair of Horn clauses that are to be resolved;
    (3) Performing resolution of the two Horn clause copies to produce 
        another Horn clause that is added to the deductive database (in 
        addition to the previously existing Horn clauses, which should remain 
        in the deductive databased unmodified).
